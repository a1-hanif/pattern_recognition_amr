== Chapter Summary

This chapter presented a comprehensive, leakage-aware methodology for antimicrobial resistance pattern recognition using phenotypic AST data. The framework integrates unsupervised discovery, supervised validation, co-resistance analysis, and system-level evaluation while maintaining strict interpretive discipline.

The methodology establishes a rigorous analytical pipeline that transforms raw AST data into validated resistance patterns through unsupervised discovery, supervised validation, and statistical association analysis. This approach ensures that resistance structures emerge from objective, data-driven processes while maintaining strict separation between pattern discovery and biological interpretation throughout all analytical stages.

The methodology ensures that resistance patterns are discovered through objective, data-driven processes and that all interpretive statements remain within appropriate associational bounds. The integrated framework supports reproducible execution and interactive exploration of results.
