// Section 6.1: Introduction
== Introduction

This chapter presents the empirical findings of the antimicrobial resistance pattern recognition analysis conducted on 491 bacterial isolates collected from the water-fish-human nexus across three Philippine regions: BARMM (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao), Region III (Central Luzon), and Region VIII (Eastern Visayas).

The results are organized into three complementary analytical approaches:

- *Unsupervised Learning Results* presents the resistance phenotype clusters identified through hierarchical agglomerative clustering, including Ward's linkage methodology, cluster characteristics, and internal validation metrics (Silhouette score, WCSS)

- *Supervised Learning Validation* evaluates the predictive validity of the clustering solution using Random Forest classification, demonstrating that cluster assignments are reproducible from resistance features alone

- *Statistical Analysis and Characterization* contextualizes the clusters through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), regional and environmental distribution patterns, and co-resistance network relationships

This progression follows a "Discovery → Validation → Interpretation" framework, wherein clusters are first identified (unsupervised), then validated for robustness (supervised), and finally characterized within their epidemiological context (statistical analysis).

The presentation adheres to a data-driven approach wherein every quantitative claim is substantiated by values extracted directly from the computed artifacts generated by the analysis pipeline @abamo2024inohac.
