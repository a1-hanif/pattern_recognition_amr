== Significance of the Study

This study significantly advances environmental AMR surveillance in the Philippines by validating a reproducible, unsupervised-supervised hybrid machine learning framework. By bridging phenotypic analysis with computational clustering, this research demonstrates the feasibility of high-resolution resistance profiling in resource-limited settings without relying on costly whole-genome sequencing. This methodological contribution not only fills a critical academic gap but also provides a scalable, open-access analytical pipeline that enables researchers and public health authorities to replicate these techniques for real-time phenotype monitoring.
